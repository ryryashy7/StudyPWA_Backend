    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, I can:\n",
    "- Explain the difference between **front-end** and **backend** web development.\n",
    "- Describe what a **web server**, **web framework**, and **library** are.\n",
    "- Run a Flask server that delivers my Study Planner to the browser.\n",
    "- Understand the basic idea of an **API** and the **HTTP request/response cycle**.\n"

    "\n",
    "A **backend** is the part of a web application that runs on the server (not in the browser).\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend is responsible for:\n",
    "- storing and retrieving data\n",
    "- sending web pages or data to the browser\n",
    "- managing user accounts and passwords\n",
    "- connecting the front-end to a database\n",
    "\n",
    "If the front-end is *what the user sees*,  \n",
    "the backend is *the behind-the-scenes engine*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backend code does **not** run on the user’s computer.  \n",

    "- loaded `index.html` directly from the computer\n",
    "- stored subjects and tasks in **localStorage**\n",
    "- worked only for **one user on one device**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of a front-end-only app\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ cannot save data permanently across devices  \n",
    "❌ cannot share or collaborate  \n",
    "❌ cannot store large amounts of data safely  \n",
    "❌ cannot handle multiple users  \n",
    "❌ cannot hide sensitive information (everyone can see localStorage data)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What adding a backend allows\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ data stored in a **database**  \n",
    "✔ sync across devices  \n",
    "✔ multiple users / login (in bigger systems)  \n",
    "✔ better security  \n",
    "✔ more complex logic  \n",
    "✔ the app behaves like a *real* web application\n",
    "\n",
    "Our backend will use:\n",
    "- **Flask** (a Python web framework)\n",
    "- **SQLite** (a small database)\n"
